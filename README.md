# Python Macro

## Installation

To use the program, you will first need to install a few modules. The modules are as following:  

* **tkinter** 
* **keyboard**
* **pyautogui** 
* **pywin32**  

They can be installed with **pip**, a package-management system. You will need to open some sort of terminal.  

**Windows 10**  
On Windows 10, you must press **'Win + R'** and then type **'cmd'** and press **'enter'**.  

**MacOS**  
On Mac, you can press **'Control + Option + Shift + T'** to open a terminal.  

Now you can download the modules, by typing the following command:  

* **pip install tkinter**
* **pip install keyboard**
* **pip install pyautogui**
* **pip install pywin32**  

If it doesn't work, please make sure:  

* You have installed Python correctly 
* You have the latest version of Python
* You have the latest version of pip  

Or, try to run your terminal as an administrator.
