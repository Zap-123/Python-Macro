# Python Macro

## Installation  

To use the program, you will first need to install a few modules. The modules are as following:  

* **tkinter** 
* **keyboard**
* **pyautogui** 
* **pywin32**  

They can be installed with **pip**, a package-management system. You will need to open some sort of terminal.  

**Windows 10**  
On Windows 10, you must press **'Win + R'** and then type **'cmd'** and press **'enter'**.  

**MacOS**  
On Mac, you can press **'Control + Option + Shift + T'** to open a terminal.  

Now you can download the modules, by typing the following command:  

* **pip install tkinter**
* **pip install keyboard**
* **pip install pyautogui**
* **pip install pywin32**  

If it doesn't work, please make sure:  

* You have installed Python correctly 
* You have the latest version of Python
* You have the latest version of pip  

Or, try to run your terminal as an administrator.  

## Tutorial  

The program can be a little confusing to work around, so here is a quick tutorial.  

When starting the program, you will see a small window with **3 buttons:**  

* **Mouse Macros**
* **Keyboard Macros**
* **Settings**  

Each button opens a new window with corresponding commands.  
Click on buttons, and input in controls in **chronological order** to be later automatically done in repeat.    
Click on the **Submit Button** to enter in any command you typed out. (You don't need to press the submit button to input controls added via buttons, only entries) and the **Close/Done** button to quit out of the window.  

Finally, when you are done entering in your "List of Controls", close out of all windows and press the corresponding keys to start and stop the macro loop. Default start and stop keys are **'+'** and **'-'** but can be changed in the **Settings** window.
